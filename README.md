Group Expensses Tracker
Managing shared expenses among groups, such as friends, families, or coworkers, can be challenging, often resulting in misunderstandings, missed payments, and poor record-keeping. A dedicated web application for group expense tracking will simplify this process by allowing users to input expenses, assign them to members, and automatically calculate balances and settlement amounts. This solution will provide transparency, improve financial organization, and foster trust among group members by giving them a clear view of shared expenses and individual contributions.
